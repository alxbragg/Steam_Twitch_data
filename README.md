# Steam & Twitch Market Saturation, Reviews, and Competitive Dynamics
## Executive Summary
This project examines the relationship between Steam game market saturation, user review sentiment, and Twitch engagement to assess competitiveness across genres and individual titles. By integrating review volume, positive versus negative sentiment, release timing, and watch/play time metrics, the analysis highlights which games achieve sustained success versus those driven by short-term trends. The findings show that strong review performance does not always translate into high viewer engagement, revealing a disconnect between player adoption and audience interest. Overall, the project provides a holistic, data-driven perspective on how consumer sentiment, market competition, and streaming behavior interact within the PC gaming ecosystem.

## Limitations & Assumptions
- Genre categorization was non-trivial because games often have multiple genre tags, leading to multiple rows per game. As a result, genre-level analysis reflects tag presence rather than mutually exclusive genre classification.
- Some games contained corrupted or incomplete Steam records and were excluded from the Steam analysis. These titles still appear in Twitch data where available, which may cause minor discrepancies between platform comparisons.
