# Steam & Twitch Market Saturation, Reviews, and Competitive Dynamics
## Executive Summary
This project examines the relationship between Steam game market saturation, user review sentiment, and Twitch engagement to assess competitiveness across genres and individual titles. By integrating review volume, positive versus negative sentiment, release timing, and watch/play time metrics, the analysis highlights which games achieve sustained success versus those driven by short-term trends. The findings show that strong review performance does not always translate into high viewer engagement, revealing a disconnect between player adoption and audience interest. Overall, the project provides a holistic, data-driven perspective on how consumer sentiment, market competition, and streaming behavior interact within the PC gaming ecosystem.
